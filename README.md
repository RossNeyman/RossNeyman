# Hey there, I'm Ross! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **Computer Science/Mathematics student** at **CUNY â€“ College of Staten Island**. My passion lies in solving complex problems, building interactive web applications, and exploring the intersections of math, computer science, and data. 
I currently work at Polygon Health on **Patient Connect**, a resource hub for those with medical conditions such as multiple myeloma, juvenile myositis, and heart failure.

## What I'm Currently Learning ðŸš€
- **React** â€“ building dynamic user interfaces
- **Node.js** â€“ developing scalable back-end services
- **Express.js** â€“ crafting robust RESTful APIs
- **PostgreSQL** â€“ managing relational databases efficiently

## Technologies & Interests
- **Full-Stack Development**: Iâ€™m expanding my skills in the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js) to create end-to-end applications.
- **Docker**: Containerizing my projects for easier deployment and development.
- **Git & GitHub**: Keeping track of my code changes and collaborating on open-source projects.
- **Mathematics and CS**: Applying mathematical concepts like discrete math, linear algebra, and calculus to algorithms and data analysis.

## Projects & Goals
- **Future Learning**: In the future, I'd love to learn more about Kafka, training AI models, and prompt engineering
